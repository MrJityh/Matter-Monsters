# MatterMonsters

# Concept 
Build a deck of cards containing Matter Monsters! Summon a Matter Monster from your hand to beat waves of enemies, allowing you to collect more Monsters and give you a better chance to beat the final boss!
# Genre
Matter Monsters is within the Wave Survival genre, with elements from arcade and combat card games!
# Audience 
Matter Monsters will be available to all players who own a PC. It is being developed in Unreal Engine 5.4.4. 
The game targets teenagers and adults who enjoy tabletop and combat card games. Players will enjoy using logic and decision-making skills as well as enjoy powered combat against wave-style enemies. Players who enjoy low-poly style graphics and simplistic UIs will enjoy the visual style of the game. 
# Scope
The game is planned to be developed within 15 weeks. With an intention to remain within a reasonable scale of development, the game is meant to be around the same scope as a game youâ€™d find within an arcade! It provides a decent challenge and is replay-able with a final goal of defeating the final boss, Time itself. Players will lose a few times before they have the best opportunities to win!
